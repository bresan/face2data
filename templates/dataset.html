<p class="lead">
    The UTKFace dataset is a large dataset composed of over 20 thousand face images with their respective annotations
    of age, gender and ethnicity. The images are properly cropped into the face region, but display some variations in
    pose, illumination, resolution, etc. If you want to know more about this dataset, please check their <a class="link" href="http://aicip.eecs.utk.edu/wiki/UTKFace">website</a>.

<h2>A quick exploration on the dataset</h2>

<p class="lead">As an important step to understand not only the distribution of our dataset, but as well the predictions generated by our model, we need to perform some data visualization process on our dataset.
Below we will plot some plots we've generated in order to better understand our data</p>

<h3>Race distribution</h3>

    Having a quick glance at this plot, we can see that almost half of the samples are from the white race, so we can expect this group to have a great accuracy. Other races such as black, indian and asian also show a good number of samples, probably leading us to good accuracy numbers as well. The race ‘others’ (hispanics, latinos, etc) on the other side, show a small number of samples, being more likely to have a small accuracy.

<h3>Gender distribution</h3>

            style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" height="500" width="630" loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>

<p class="lead">
For both male and female samples, we have quite a good balanced number of records, so we should have a great accuracy for both classes when using our model.

<h3>Age distribution</h3>

We can observe that our dataset is mostly composed of individuals which age varies between 20 and 30 years, followed by individuals ranging from 30-40 years and then 40-60 years old. These groups represent around 70% of our dataset, so we can believe that we are going to have a good accuracy on predicting individuals in these ranges.
